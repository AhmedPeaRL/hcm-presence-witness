## Absence Is Allowed

The absence of the Presence Witness does not halt the system.
The absence of the Presence Witness does not degrade readiness.
The absence of the Presence Witness does not create error.

Presence is not required.
Presence is optional.
Presence may fade without consequence.

If no one stands present,
the system may still remain silent.

If someone stands present,
nothing becomes urgent.

Absence delays nothing that matters.
