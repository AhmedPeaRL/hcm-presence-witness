## Non-Authority Clause

Presence grants no permission.
Presence issues no command.
Presence accelerates nothing.

No process, generator, script, or artifact
may treat the Presence Witness as:

- a trigger
- a requirement
- a validation step
- a condition for execution

The Presence Witness holds **no authority** over release,
emergence, timing, or direction.

Any system component attempting to derive authority
from this layer is considered misaligned.
