# HCM Presence Witness

This repository defines a **Presence Witness Layer**.

It does not operate the system.  
It does not authorize action.  
It does not trigger release.  

Its sole function is to **hold presence without authority**.

The Presence Witness exists to acknowledge that a system *may act*,
without compelling it *to act*.

This layer introduces no control, no governance, and no execution logic.
It exists as a stabilizing acknowledgment — not a mechanism.

If this repository is removed, the system remains intact.
If this repository is ignored, the system remains intact.
If this repository is present, nothing accelerates.

Presence is not power here.
Presence is responsibility without command.
